### Disclaimer
In no way I claim authority over the comics shown in the app. Each comic has its own author and if you like the comic go show it in the home page by buying some stuff or commenting or whatever. If you see your work represented in this app and would like it to dissappear write an email to admin at comicagg dot com.

This software uses the library Scribe v1.3.0 with the MIT license. You can find such library in GitHub at https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java I would like to thank the author Pablo Fernandez and everyone that collaborated with such project. It has been really useful in order to create my app.

And last but not least, this app would be nothing without the webpage www.comicagg.com done my friend Jesús Fernández-Sáez. Thank you.
